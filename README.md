#screenGIFfier

create a gif from the screen of your connected iPhone (iDevice)

press control+C to stop and create the gif...

this little utility use the Library libMobileDeviceAccess, an open source objC wrapper for the MobileDevice framework

As I saw in the lib code, probably it needs that your device is "used for Development" (you must click the button in XCode organizer)... for that I didn't create a GUI...
